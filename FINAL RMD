### Subset Records by Team, Year, Name, Event, Medal
athlete_events_recode = athlete_events_summer_na.wmedals %>% group_by(Team , Year , Name , Event , Medal) %>% 
       summarize()
### Recode Medals into Numerical vallues
athlete_events_recode$medal_value[athlete_events_recode$Medal == "Gold"] <- 1
athlete_events_recode$medal_value[athlete_events_recode$Medal == "Silver"] <- 1

athlete_events_recode$medal_value[is.na(athlete_events_recode$Medal)] <- 0
### Set Variables for FOR LOOP - Country and Host Years must match by Indicies
Countries = c("Italy", "Japan", "Mexico", "Spain","United States","Australia","Greece","China")

### Begin FOR LOOP - Loop Provides an Anova Table and two Graphs per Country
for(i in 1:8){
  
  ## Index of Host Country and Olympic Year

  ### Subset table by Country
  
  athlete_events_country = athlete_events_recode[ which(athlete_events_recode$Team == Country),]

  ### Subset by First Year
  
  athlete_events_first = athlete_events_country[ which(athlete_events_country$Year == First_Year),]

  ### Subset by Before Year
  
  athlete_events_before = athlete_events_country[ which(athlete_events_country$Year == Before_Year),]

  ### Subset by Host Year 
  
  athlete_events_host = athlete_events_country[ which(athlete_events_country$Year == Host_Year),]
  
  ### Subset by after Year
  
  athlete_events_after = athlete_events_country[ which(athlete_events_country$Year == After_Year),]
  
  ### Subset by Last Year
